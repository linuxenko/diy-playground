This application plays sound thrown via usb line. It is a bit dirty and almost has
no useful comments, but it works well. There is a problem with vusb itself, it does
not work well and stable on heavy data streams, will try to investigate the problem
is it possible to fix it somehow. Currently it is enough to handle and correct the
stream using host software, simple repeating missing messages.
