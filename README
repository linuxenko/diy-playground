Yet another bunch of example applications and information about avr programming.
===============================================================================

I've decided to gather everything that interested me in avr programming
inside of a single repository to share it. While I'm learning different
techniques and tricks playing around with avr, the repository is going to grow.


Table of contents
===============================================================================

I'm trying to provide every application with short description in README file,
as well, an information could be provided inside of its source code files.

  documentation  This folder contains some related documentation and things I'm unable to remember, so, now it
  is the place to search instead of making another web search request.

  blink       General "hello world" application for microcontrollers in particular for an avr controller.
  blink-int   The same application using avr timer with interruption
  blink-timer Custom timer countdown check inside of main loop
  pcm-sound   Example of an avr timer usage to play sound using nothing but Mk.



Notes
===============================================================================

Makefiles were borrowed form the v-usb project, they have to be configured for an
exact hardware you're intended to build it for (device type, oscillator frequency,
fuses and maybe avrdude's staff to make "make program" work properly").
