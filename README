Yet another bunch of example applications and information about avr programming.
===============================================================================

I've decided to gather everything that interested me in avr programming
inside of a single repository to share it. While I'm learning different
techniques and tricks playing around the avr the repository is going to grow.


Notes
===============================================================================

Makefiles were borrowed form the v-usb project, they have to be configured for an
exact hardware you're intended to build it for (device type, oscillator frequency,
fuses and maybe avrdude staff to make "make program" work properly").
